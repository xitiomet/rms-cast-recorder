## RMSCastRecorder

A tool for recording Ham Radio related shoutcast or icecast streams. This tool will listen to a shoutcast or icecast stream and only record when there is audio (root-mean-square activation) I found myself wishing i had an easy straightfoward way to record a stream without the long silences between transmissions. RMSCastRecorder will organize the produced wav files into folders by date, and the filename will include the stream title and timestamp.

Example output with -o ./recordings

A recording will be created as follows:

`./recordings/2026-03-12/2026-03-12_024630_RadPi.wav`

Regular builds can be found at [rms-cast-recorder downloads](https://openstatic.org/projects/rms-cast-recorder/#downloads) (scroll to the bottom)

### Optional PHP Interface
![](https://openstatic.org/projects/rms-cast-recorder/recordings_php.png)
In the subdirectory php is a web interface for browsing and reviewing the recordings. All you need is a php capable web server.

you can edit the index.php or create a config.php file with the following variables:
```php
// Settings
$recordingsRoot = '/mnt/Media/recordings';
$PAGE_TITLE = 'Icecast Stream Recordings';
// End Settings
```

## Usage

Once the jar is built you can run the recorder against either a Shoutcast/Icecast stream URL or audio from stdin.
Recordings are broken into WAV files whenever the stream goes silent and are placed in day‑based folders. At the top of the file you will see two variables, set these accordingly.

URL example:
```bash
$ ./rms-cast-recorder \
      -u http://example.com:8000/stream.mp3 \
  -o ./recordings \
  -x /usr/local/bin/on-clip-written.sh \
  -r 8000 -c 1 -b 16
```

stdin example (`arecord`):
```bash
$ arecord -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 8000 -t wav - \
  | ./rms-cast-recorder --stdin -o ./recordings
```

stdin example (`sox`):
```bash
$ sox /path/to/input.mp3 -t wav - \
  | ./rms-cast-recorder --stdin -o ./recordings
```

raw PCM stdin example (`arecord`):
```bash
$ arecord -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 8000 -t raw - \
  | ./rms-cast-recorder --stdin --stdin-raw \
    --stdin-rate 8000 --stdin-channels 1 --stdin-bits 16 \
    -o ./recordings
```

## Options

* -u,--url <URL> – stream URL to capture (mutually exclusive with --stdin)
* -i,--stdin – read audio from stdin (mutually exclusive with --url)
* --stdin-raw – treat stdin as raw PCM bytes (requires --stdin)
* --stdin-rate <HZ> – raw stdin sample rate (default matches --sample-rate)
* --stdin-channels <N> – raw stdin channels (default matches --channels)
* --stdin-bits <BITS> – raw stdin bit depth (default matches --bitrate)
* --stdin-big-endian – raw stdin byte order is big-endian (default little-endian)
* --stdin-unsigned – raw stdin encoding is unsigned PCM (default signed PCM)
* -o,--out <DIR> – base directory for recordings (default ./recordings)
* -t,--threshold <DB> – silence threshold in dB (default -50)
* -s,--silence <SECONDS> – how long the signal must stay below threshold to
  end a clip (default 2)
* -r,--sample-rate <HZ> – output sample rate in Hz (default 8000)
* -c,--channels <N> – output channels (1 mono, 2 stereo; default 1)
* -b,--bitrate <BITS> – output PCM bit depth in bits (default 16)
* -n,--name <STREAM> – override stream name used in output filenames
* -x,--on-write <PROGRAM> – optional script/program to run each time a WAV is
  written; if {wav} is omitted, the full WAV path is passed as argument 1
* -?,--help – display help and exit

Exactly one input source is required: `--url` or `--stdin`.

When using --stdin without --stdin-raw, provide a Java Sound readable stream format (WAV is recommended).

Raw format flags (--stdin-rate, --stdin-channels, --stdin-bits, --stdin-big-endian, --stdin-unsigned) require --stdin-raw.

When recording from --url, filenames default to stream metadata (icy-name/x-audiocast-name/ice-name) unless --name is provided.

WAV files include stream name metadata in the title field.

WAV files written from --url input also include a comment metadata field with the original source URL.

Examples for --on-write:

* -x /usr/local/bin/on-clip-written.sh
* -x "/usr/local/bin/on-clip-written.sh --tag repeater-a" (WAV path is still arg1)
* -x "/usr/bin/python3 /opt/hooks/process_clip.py {wav} --mode fast"
